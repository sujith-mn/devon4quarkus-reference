= OpenTelemetry deployment

Quarkus applications can easily use OpenTelemetry to collect information about traces and metrics.
This guide describes how to set up the application to support OpenTelemetry for exporting and visualizing traces and spans with tools such as Jaeger, VictoriaMetrics, and Grafana.

For this setup you need a Kubernetes cluster, an installation of Helm and a local Docker registry.

== Preparation of the application

First, you need to create the application and Docker image. Use the following commands to package the application, create the Docker image, and push it to your local Docker registry.

[shell]
----
mvn clean package

docker build src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm . -t demo-quarkus
docker tag demo-quarkus name-of-your-registry/demo-quarkus
docker push name-of-your-registry/demo-quarkus
----

After this the Docker image should be available in your Docker registry.

== Deploy the OpenTelemetry components

To deploy the components needed for the OpenTelemetry setup, we use the Helm template from the link:https://github.com/devonfw/architectures/tree/master/solutions/monitoring_openTelemetry/helm[devonfw architecture repository].
Download the folder from Github or clone the repository by executing `git clone https://github.com/devonfw/architectures.git`.
Before we can deploy the Helm chart, we need to change some values in the `values.yaml` file. Set the following properties.

[yaml]
----
application:
  metrics:
    jobname: "demo-quarkus"
    url: "/q/metrics"
  
  service:
    name: "demo-quarkus"
    port: 8080
  
  ...
----

The install the Helm chart by executing `helm install opentelemetry helm` (make sure to pass the correct path to the Helm chart as the last parameter).

This will deploy the following components:

* OpenTelemetry agent
* OpenTelemetry collector
* Jaeger
* VictoriaMetrics
* Grafana

== Configure the application

The Quarkus application uses the `quarkus-opentelemetry-exporter-otlp` extension to export the traces. The extension is already added to the project. We just need to configure the application accordingly.
To do this, set the following environment variables in the `helm/templates/application-deployment.yaml` file.

[yaml]
----
...
- name: quarkus.opentelemetry.enabled
  value: "true"
- name: quarkus.opentelemetry.tracer.exporter.otlp.endpoint
  value: http://otel-agent:4317
- name: quarkus.application.name
  value: demo-quarkus
...
----

This will enable the export of the traces to the OpenTelemetry collector.

== Testing the components

After these steps, the application and components for OpenTelemetry should work properly.
To verify the application, first open http://demo-quarkus.localhost/products in your browser. You should receive a JSON response listing all the products in the database.

Open the Jaeger user interface by navigating to http://jaeger.localhost/search in your browser to view the application traces. Select "demo-quarkus" as the service name and view the results. Each time you make a request to the application, you should see a new record. 

Now let's take a look at the metrics. Navigate to http://grafana.localhost/ in your browser to open Grafana. Log in with the default username and password `admin`. Go to the configuration area and add a new datasource to view the metrics.
Select the "Prometheus" entry (VictoriaMetrics is compatible with Prometheus) and enter http://victoriametrics.default.svc.cluster.local:8428 as the URL.
After that you should be able to see the metrics in the Grafana Dashboard.
